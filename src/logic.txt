I have 3 different components called,
    1. Heading
    2. Paragraph
    3. SubTitle

I wanted to Increase the font size with the same size.

Instead of increasing font size diffrently we can create a short code for increase font size. 
This is also a component.
Then we can wrap related component with this component like in the App.tsx file.

So finally i can add a same logic for a component without affecting to component code.
